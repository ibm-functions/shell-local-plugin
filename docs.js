When replaying an activation, the plugin will fetch its previous activation (if available) to get the input data. You can also provide the input data with -p. Return the output and execution time.</div>',
    debug: '<div><b>local debug <i>action_name_or_activation_id</i> [-p name value]</b>: **Only for NodeJs** Run an action or activation locally, and open Chrome DevTool in the sidecar for live debugging. Return the output.</div>',
    init: '<div><b>local init <i>action_name</i></b>: Start a Docker container with the runtime image of an action (but not yet execute the action). This command is mostly used internally by Shell.</div>',
    kill: `<div><b>local kill</b>: Kill and remove the Docker container this plugin uses. This command is mostly used internally by Shell. The container is removed automatically when you exit Shell.</div>`,
    clean: `<div><b>local clean</b>: Remove the local copy of the docker images.</div>`
